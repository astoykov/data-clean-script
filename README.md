# data-clean-script
A Python script to clean customer contact data

**Purpose**
This script should help clean a customer contact data file containing three columns: *name, phone* and *email*.
There can be various type of quality issues, especially with user generated content. 

1. Common data problems at field level:
 * empty/blank field values
 * unrecognised encoding for text fields
 * too long values for a particular field
 * badly formatted value - becomes unparsable
 * malicious content (shell script commands, SQL injection, etc)

2. Type data problems at field level:
 * emails are not properly formatted
 * email domains not existing or no email servers
 * too many personal names
 * phone number code is unrecognised

3. Data issues at record level:
 * if one or more fields are considered a throwaway, should we still keep the record?
 * if either the phone or the email is missing/invalid - should we still keep the record?

4. Data issues at column level:
 * Are there any duplicates for the email and what to do if corresponding names are different?

The script addresses only few of those as a start. To enhance it more libraries and checks can be added, for example:
- Check if the result of the DNS lookup on the email domain
- Check if there is an SMPT server listening at the email domain
- Check if email domains are not mistyped by comparing to a reference list of email provider domains and use soundex indexing
- Check if names are very similar using a soundex index


**The data file**
The data file contains 1000 records in three columns: *name, phone* and *email*. it was generated by using https://mockaroo.com/

**Prerequisites:**
- Python 3
- phonenumbers library https://pypi.python.org/pypi/phonenumbers

**To test:**

After you've downloaded the script and test data and installed the phonenumbers library:

*python clean.py*

This should produce cleandata.csv that has some only the best data.
